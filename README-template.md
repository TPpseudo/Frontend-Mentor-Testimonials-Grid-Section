## My process

- Started off with a CSS reset
- HTML
- CSS with mobile first workflow
- Desktop version last

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my second project where I made use of grid, so this was a pleasant learning experience. As there are repetative styling elements it was an interesting challenge to figure out how to re-use classes.

### Continued development

I would like to further extend my knowledge on Grid. I might try CSS Normalize in my following project to be able to make a comparison with 'Reset'.
